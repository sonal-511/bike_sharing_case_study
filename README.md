## General Information
Building a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Conclusions
- weather conditions play an important role in bike sharing demand
- during summer and winters people rent more bikes hence more focus should be there on expanding businees in these weather conditions
- during light snow or cloudy weather settings company might see a less demand in bikes as its  ha a negative correlation with target variable
- the company should keep expanding its business as when passing year the demands are increaing
- Temperature is a strong indicator for bike share count, it has a high positive coefficent in the regression equation
- Bike rentals are less on holidays
